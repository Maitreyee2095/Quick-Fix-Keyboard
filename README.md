# Quick-Fix-Keyboard
## PES-Project
### TECH USED
* GPIO LINES
* DMA
* DAC
* UART
* COMMAND PROCESSING
* CIRCULAR BUFFERS

THIS PROJECT IS IMPLEMENTATION OF MOST OF THE THINGS LEARNT IN THE COURSE ECEN 5813:PRINCIPLES OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS TAUGHT BY: HOWDY PIERCE

#### OBJECTIVE : 
To create a piano using FRDM KL25Z, keyboard matrix and speaker for output.The Piano would have 8 keys, arranged in a matrix form of 2X4 matrix representing 8 classical Indian notes namely 'Sa' , 'Re','Ga','Ma','Pa', 'Dha','Ni', 'Sa'.

#### [SUPPLEMENT PART] : 
TO add a functionality , where when user enters the name of the song it plays the saved tune.

#### Implementation:
Was able to meet the requirement of the project, Integrated a 2X4 matrix representing 8 classical indian notes. 
Also implemented UART functionality, If user enters 
Added a functionality to record the keys a user plays on the keyboard and play it back.
* If the user enters the command record on the terminal, it starts recording , users keyboard inputs.
* If the user enters the command play, it plays back whatever the users keyboard inputs after user pressed record.
*The user can play recorded tune as many time they want until the user commands to record again.


#### BOARD DESIGN :
As the FRDM KL25Z board already has internal pull up resistors so haven't added any external pull ups.
Used a RC filter for speaker, to reduce noise.

#### Testing
##### Automated Tests: 
A test function is written to check if Sine wave generated is in the limited error, as given by prof Howdy Pierce. Test function is written to thoroughly check the circular buffer.
##### Manual Tests 
This project consists of some manual tests that need to be carried out to check the functionality of hardware elements included, for this a test outline pdf is included in the repo.

#### Reference and Credits

The code from earlier assignment was used with certain changes, like implementation of comand handler table and changes in sys_write and sys_read function as suggested by Prof Howdy Pierce in his lecture series.

Would also like to thank Alex Fritz  and Camilla Hallin for providing me the proto bread board,  speaker, and push buttons to build the piano.
And  Soham Kelkar for the PIANO notes for the songs.
